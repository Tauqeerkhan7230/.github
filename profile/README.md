Fake PhonePe APK refers to unofficial or counterfeit versions of the original PhonePe app, designed to mimic its appearance and functionality. These apps are often used for unethical purposes, including scams, phishing, and other fraudulent activities. Unlike the official app, which is available on the Google Play Store and App Store, Fake PhonePe APKs are typically distributed through unauthorized websites and third-party app stores.

These fake apps lure users by promising additional features, free cashbacks, or access without verification. However, their primary purpose is usually to collect sensitive user data or trick users into financial losses.
